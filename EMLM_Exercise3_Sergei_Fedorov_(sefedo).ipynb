        "I have a long-term research project regarding a specific set of proteins. I am attempting to discover small organic compounds that can bind strongly to these proteins and thus act as drugs. I have already made laboratory experiments to measure the affinities between some proteins and drug molecules.\n",
        "\n",
        "My colleague is working on another set of proteins, and the objectives of his project are similar to mine. He has recently discovered thousands of new potential drug molecules. He asked me if I could find the pairs that have the strongest affinities among his proteins and drug molecules. Obviously I do not have the resources to measure all the possible pairs in my laboratory, so I need to prioritise. I decided to do this with the help of machine learning, but I have encountered a problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is what I have done so far: First I trained a K-nearest neighbours regressor with the parameter value K=10 using all the 400 measurements I had already made in the laboratory with my proteins and drug molecules. They comprise of 77 target proteins and 59 drug molecules. To estimate the generalisation performance of the model, I then performed a leave-one-out cross-validation. I used C-index and got a stellar score above 90%. Finally I used the model to predict the affinities of my colleague's proteins and drug molecules. The problem is that when I selected the highest predicted affinities and my colleague tried to verify them in the lab, we found that many of them are much lower in reality. My model clearly does not work despite the high cross-validation score. We also tested the model with my proteins against my colleague's drugs (which is another task I would like to use my model for), but the model did not work there either.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please explain why my estimation failed and how leave-one-out cross-validation should be performed to get reliable estimates. Also, please implement the leave-one-out cross-validation correctly and report the numbers I need. I want to know whether it would be a waste of my colleague's and my resources if we were to use my model any further.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data I used to create my model is available in the files `input.data`, `output.data` and `pairs.data` for you to use. The first file contains the features of the pairs, whereas the second contains their affinities. The third file contains the identifiers of the drug and target molecules of which the pairs are composed. The files are paired, i.e. the i<sup>*th*</sup> row in each file is about the same pair.\n",

The bioscientist who has ordered the work didn't take into consideration this fact while implementing cross-validation. As a result, the performance estimation turned out to be too optimistic because each time the training set and the test one contained observations with shared objects, drugs or proteins, and, hence, there was data leakage: some information about test datapoints was in the training set. Evidently, when used for that colleague's data the model got absolutely new objects without any relation with the data it had been trained on and its prediction ability occured to be much worse than it was expected.\n",

        "* The task was to evaluate an ML model's performance on pair-input data. The data for training and   evaluation encompass 400 observation measuring some pairwise affinities between 77 target proteins and 59 drug molecules. The model was $K$-Nearest Neighbours regressor with $K = 10$. The evaluation had to be implemented with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV). The performance score supposed to be expressed by C-index.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The initial approach to the model performance estimation was faulty because it didn't take into account the \"paired nature\" of the data. Every time the CV splitting of data took place, some objects (a drug or a protein) could be and most probably were in the training data and in the test datum at the same time. This caused data leakage and overestimation of the model's performance because, trying to predict the affinity value for a test observation, the model already had some information about objects participating in this observation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The initial code was generated by Mistrale Large AI agent (link to the discussion: https://studychat.ai.utu.fi/share/cs8KdQzNF-97pXGajRDOP). The prompt contained the task description only. The agent implemented the same faulty approach with generic LOOCV.\n",
        "Another, smaller issue of the code was in the point when and how scaling of data was performed: before splitting and fitted on all dataset instead of fitting on the training part only, hence, after splitting. Most probably, it wouldn't affect the result in this specific task, but still.\n",
        "\n",
        "* That code yielded the C-index of 0.83 which is, again, too optimistic, for the reason mentioned above.\n",
        "After fixing the code, AI proposed a variant that apparently worked in a quite correct way.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The final code (see [here](#scrollTo=Final_version_of_the_code)) for the task is a somewhat \"rephrased\" version of the AI's suggestion, which, honestly, wasn't worth it since the new version seems to be no better then the code corrected by AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Lastly, the estimate of the model's prediction performance quality expressed with C-index occured to be about 0.51, which is extremely low value (random guessing provides C-index = ROC AUC of 0.50).\n",
        "The obtained results indicate that the model is very bad for predicting drug-protein affinity on this dataset. Hence, it shouldn't be recommended for using by the colleague for the similar problem on their data, too."
